# mersenne-prime
Mersenne prime calculator made in JavaScript. 
Just change the variable in the first for loop to calculate a higher mersenne prime. I'm not responsible for any computer crashes. Please if your computer can only handle going up to 50 in the for loop just keep the code as is.
Don't let your interest get the best of you.
